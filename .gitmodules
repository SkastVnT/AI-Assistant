# ============================================================================
# Removed broken submodule entries (no URL configured, causing CI failures)
# ============================================================================
#
# The following submodules were removed from .gitmodules because they had no
# URL field, causing "fatal: No url found for submodule path" errors:
#
# 1. ChatBot/models/BloomVN-8B-chat
# 2. ChatBot/models/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct
# 3. stable-diffusion-webui/models/OrangeMixs
#
# To re-add a submodule with proper URL:
# [submodule "path/to/submodule"]
#   path = path/to/submodule
#   url = <repository-url>
