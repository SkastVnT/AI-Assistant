# Validation dataset (optional)

# This folder is optional but recommended for monitoring training quality
# Use 10-20% of your total dataset as validation

# Example split:
# - 450 training images -> data/train/
# - 50 validation images -> data/val/

# Validation images should follow the same structure as training data:
# - Images with corresponding .txt caption files
# - Same naming convention
# - Same quality standards

# Place your validation images here!
