# Example dataset structure for LoRA training

# This folder should contain your training images and captions
# Each image should have a corresponding .txt file with the same name

# Example:
# portrait001.jpg
# portrait001.txt  -> "a photo of sks person, professional lighting"
# portrait002.jpg
# portrait002.txt  -> "a photo of sks person, smiling, outdoors"

# Supported image formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp, .bmp

# Caption Guidelines:
# - Use a trigger word (e.g., "sks person", "xyz style")
# - Describe the image content after the trigger
# - Be specific but concise
# - Include important details (lighting, mood, composition)

# Example captions for character training:
# "a photo of sks person, portrait, natural lighting"
# "a photo of sks person, full body, standing"
# "a photo of sks person, close-up, smiling"

# Example captions for style training:
# "landscape in watercolor style"
# "portrait in anime style"
# "cityscape in cyberpunk style"

# Place your images and caption files here!
