# Keep default severity to LOW but we'll make CI fail only on HIGH via parser
# B101: assert_used - common in tests
# B110: try_except_pass - acceptable pattern in many cases
# B112: try_except_continue - acceptable pattern in many cases
# B603: subprocess_without_shell_equals_true - shell=False is safer but flagged anyway
